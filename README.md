# Raisin-Classification-KNN_NaiveBayes

Attribute Information:

Area: Gives the number of pixels within the boundaries of the raisin.

Perimeter: It measures the environment by calculating the distance between the boundaries of the raisin and the pixels around it.

MajorAxisLength: Gives the length of the main axis, which is the longest line that can be drawn on the raisin.

MinorAxisLength: Gives the length of the small axis, which is the shortest line that can be drawn on the raisin.

Eccentricity: It gives a measure of the eccentricity of the ellipse, which has the same moments as raisins.

ConvexArea: Gives the number of pixels of the smallest convex shell of the region formed by the raisin.

Extent: Gives the ratio of the region formed by the raisin to the total pixels in the bounding box.

Class: Kecimen and Besni raisin.
